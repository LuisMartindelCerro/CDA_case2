# CDA_case2

This is an Academic Project from the *02582 Computational Data Analysis* course at Denmark Technical University (DTU).

## Information about the project

The case consists of doing an exploratory (unsupervised) analysis using the data source or parts of the data source. Please choose one of the following three topics and continue your exploration along that for the case:

- Explore clustering methods to derive insights from the data.
- Use decomposition and subspace methods to investigate low-dimension representation of the data.
- Employ Canonical correlation analysis and other supervised methods to model the response (emotions) using the features as input.


You will be using the `EmoPair Compete` dataset which is described in `case description 2025.pdf`. An interpretation of the model should be present. You are allowed to use other data sources as well. You may supplement your unsupervised analysis with a supervised analysis, if you wish. Formulate a clear purpose for your project, so the aim of your analysis is clear. What are your research questions? What kind of representation would you like to derive from the features of the biosignals? What could it be used for?
